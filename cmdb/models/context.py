"""
Knowledge Kernel Query Context Model — Execution Metadata

Represents WHEN and HOW a query was executed.

NEVER mixed with Entity facts.

Usage:
- Temporal reasoning: "Was this fact true 1 hour ago?"
- Caching: "Do I need to re-query or is cached data still fresh?"
- Versioning: "Which CMDB version provided this data?"

    Query execution metadata.
    
    This belongs to the QUERY, not the ENTITY.
    
    Example scenario:
    
    Query 1 (10:00 AM):
      result = cmdb_get("ollama")
      # result.context.queried_at = "2026-06-22T10:00:00"

      result = cmdb_get("ollama")
      # result.context.queried_at = "2026-06-22T11:00:00"
    
    Entity is the same. Query context differs.
    
    Fields:
    - queried_at: When the query ran (ISO format)
    - cmdb_version: Version of CMDB that served the query
    - entities_dir: Which directory was queried (for debugging multi-CMDB setups)
